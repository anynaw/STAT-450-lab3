To find the relationship between bill length and bill depth for each species of penguins, we will consider a linear regression model: Bill Depth (bill_depth_mm) = beta0 + beta1 * Bill Length (bill_length_mm) + beta2 * Species + sigma. After fitting the model, we need to verify that the residuals of the model are following normal distribution by checking the Q-Q plot, and residuals have the equal variance along different observations by checking the plot of Residuals VS Fitted. From the model summary, we can verify the hypothesis from the previous question.
